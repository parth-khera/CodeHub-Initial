Problems with traditional platforms:

HackerRank / LeetCode

Isolated problem solving

No real project connection

Feels academic, not real-world

Codeforces / CodeChef / VJudge

Great for contests

Weak for project building

No long-term portfolio integration

GitHub

Only storage, no guidance

No structured learning path

No competition or motivation system

Devfolio

Event-based, not continuous growth

Focused on hackathons only

Discord

Chaotic knowledge

No permanent structured progress

More chat than learning

CodeDex / AlgoPath

Learning-focused but limited

No collaboration or competition depth

Overall issue:
Every platform solves one problem well,
but none solve the journey.

CodeHub’s philosophy:

“Don’t build coders who only solve problems.
Don’t build coders who only push code.
Build coders who think, build, collaborate, and compete.”

In one line:

CodeHub is inspired by the idea that coding should feel like a sport academy + engineering lab + open-source community + competitive arena, all in one place.

That’s why it’s not just a platform.
It’s a movement
