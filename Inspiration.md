The inspiration behind CodeHub comes from one simple observation:
developers today are forced to jump between too many platforms to grow.

You practice DSA on LeetCode or Codeforces.
You host code on GitHub.
You collaborate on Discord.
You compete on CodeChef or VJudge.
You build projects somewhere else.
You showcase work on Devfolio.

Everything is powerful, but everything is scattered.

Growth becomes fragmented.

CodeHub was imagined as a response to this fragmentation.

Not another platform that replaces them, but a unified ecosystem that connects all these activities into one continuous developer journey.
