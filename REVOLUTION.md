Why this is a revolution:

Because CodeHub treats coding as a sport + craft + community.

Not just:

“Solve problems”

“Upload code”

“Join a contest”

But:

Train like an athlete

Build like an engineer

Collaborate like a team

Compete like a champion

Grow like a professional

It merges:

Practice (DSA)

Production (Projects)

Performance (Contests)

People (Collaboration)

into one identity.

That’s what makes it different.
