Why we decided to build it:

Because learning should feel like a flow, not a maze.
A coder should be able to:

Practice → Build → Collaborate → Compete → Showcase
in one place, without switching identities, tools, or mindsets.

Most platforms focus on only one dimension:

HackerRank / LeetCode → only problems

GitHub → only code storage

Devfolio → only hackathons

Discord → only chat

Codeforces / CodeChef → only competitive programming

None of them capture the complete developer life cycle.

CodeHub is built to represent the whole developer, not just one skill.
